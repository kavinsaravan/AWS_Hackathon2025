## 🎯 What Problem Are We Solving?

We aim to provide an integrated platform that:

- Gathers real-time or near-real-time traffic and safety data for the city of San Francisco.  
- Processes this data via serverless compute (Lambdas) and generates a risk score or safety index for specific locations or routes.  
- Presents the information to users via a web interface, enabling informed decision-making around travel, commuting, or path-planning.  
- Demonstrates a scalable architecture using AWS services and modern web stack components.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, built in the `frontend/` folder.  
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI API in the `backend/` folder.  
- **Serverless**: Multiple Lambdas under `risk-scorer-analysis-lambda/`, `sf-safety-fetch-lambda/`, `sf-traffic-fetch-lambda/`.  
- **Data Sources**: 311 Reports API for call data, Real-Time PD Dispatch Reports API for dispatch report data, Graphhopper API for interactive map routing data.
- **AWS Services**: Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Bedrock  
- **Scripts & Environment**: Batch scripts (`.bat`) for Windows environment, `.env` file for environment variables.
